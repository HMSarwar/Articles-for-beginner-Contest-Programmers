/*This is the algorithm for Longest common subsequence
whose complexity is O(n*m) without using DP*/

Algorithm LCS:

	for i:=0 to m
		temp:=i, length=0;
		for j:=0 to n
			if string1[temp]==string2[j]
				temp++, length++
			else
				maxlen:= maximum of maxlen and lengh, length:=0, temp:=i;
		maxlen:= maximum of maxlen and lengh

/*Hope it will help you implement Longest Common Subsequence without any variations. For further advanced implementation DP is recommended. */
